# Teach Agent To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

In this Python Reinforcement Learning Tutorial series we teach an AI to play Snake! We build everything from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch. The origin idea is from [python engineer](https://github.com/python-engineer/snake-ai-pytorch)

## Get started

Environment: Ubuntu 20.04

```bash
chmod +x install_python.sh
./install_python.sh
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Play by human
python snake_game_human.py

## Train snake agent
python agent.py
